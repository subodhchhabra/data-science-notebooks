    "As we have identified earlier, TensorFlow allows us to create a graph of operations and variables. These variables are called **Tensors**, and represent data, whether that is a single number, a string, a matrix, or something else. **Tensors** are combined through operations, and this whole process is modelled in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you have your **tensorenv** virtual environment activated, Once it is activated type in **conda install jupyter** to install jupter books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, run **jupyter notebook** to launch a browser session of the Jupyter Notebook (previously called the IPython Notebook). (If your browser doesn’t open, open it and type **localhost:8888** into the browser’s address bar.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click “New” and then “Python 3” under “Notebooks”. This will launch a new browser tab. Give the notebook a name by clicking “Untitled” at the top and give it a name (I used “Interactive TensorFlow”).\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you have never used a Jupyter Notebook (or IPython Notebook) before, take a look [at this site](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) for a brief introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, as before, let’s create a basic TensorFlow program. One major change is the use of an **InteractiveSession**, which allows us to run variables without needing to constantly refer to the session object (less typing!). Code blocks below are broken into different cells. If you see a break in the code, you will need to run the previous cell first. Also, if you aren’t otherwise confident, ensure all of the code in a given block is type into a cell before you run it."
